# Basic Chatbot with Animated Earth Background

This is a simple chatbot built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The chatbot answers user questions and keeps track of chat history.

## Technologies used

1. **HTML (Structure)**: Defines the parts of the page:
   - A chat box where the conversation happens.
   - An input field where users can type their questions.
   - A button to send the question to the chatbot.

2. **CSS (Design)**: 
   - The background has an animated Earth image that moves from right to left.
   - The chat box has a grey color with rounded corners.
   - The text is styled using the **Castellar** font to make it look more elegant.

3. **JavaScript (Functionality)**:
   - When you type a question and press "Send", the chatbot reads your message.
   - The chatbot will check the message for certain keywords (like "hello" or "your name") and respond with a pre-written answer.
   - The chat history grows as the conversation continues, and you can see all past messages.
